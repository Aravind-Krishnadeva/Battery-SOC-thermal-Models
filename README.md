# Battery-SOC-thermal-Models
Electro thermal model of a single cell 18650 battery 

This repositary contains thermal model  of a 2RC single cell battery. This model exhibits thermal behaviour of the battery due to the effect of reversible and irreversible heat generated in a battery. The process employed in this model involves the following steps

1. Create a 2RC model of a battery
2. Add a ohmic power dissipation to the 2RC model
3. Add a entropic power dissipation block to the 2RC model
4. Add a thermal block to the model
5. Add a dashboard block to add inputs and verify outputs

## Pre requisites
1. Simulink
2. Simscape Electrical
